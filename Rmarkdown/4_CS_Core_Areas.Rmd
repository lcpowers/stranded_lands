### 1. Packages and data
```{r packages_data}

library(tidyverse)
library(rgdal)
library(raster)
library(sf)
library(parallel)
library(rgeos)
library(cleangeo)

# NLCD MT raster
mt_nlcd <- raster("../R_output_files/nlcd/mt_nlcd_270.tif")

# Montana Outline
mt_outline <- read_sf("../R_input_files/mt_outline/StateofMontana.shp") %>% 
  st_transform(.,crs(mt_nlcd))

# Montana Counties
mt_counties <- read_sf("../R_input_files/mt_counties/County.shp") %>% 
  st_transform(.,crs(mt_nlcd))

# Protected Areas Database 
pad <- read_sf("../R_input_files/mt_pad/PAD_combined_clean.shp") %>%
  st_transform(.,crs(mt_nlcd)) %>% 
  st_simplify()

```

### 2. Protected Areas Database (PAD) GAP Core Areas
```{r pad_gap}
# Filter for GAP 1 or 2 parcels -- parcels that manage for biodiversity
pad_gap <- pad %>% 
  filter(GAP_Sts %in% c(1,2)) %>% 
  group_by(GAP_Sts) %>% 
  summarise() %>% 
  st_buffer(.,200) %>% 
  as(.,"Spatial") %>%
  disaggregate(.) %>%
  st_as_sf() %>% 
  st_buffer(.,-200 ) %>% 
  dplyr::select() %>% 
  mutate("category" = "pad_gap",
    "object_id" = paste0(1:nrow(.),"_gap"))


```

### 3. Adding in Fish and Wildlife 
```{r fishandwildlife}
# Montana Fish, Wildlife, and Parks Land Parcels
fwp = read_sf("../R_input_files/MT_FWP_Lands_Parcels_shp/020b61ed-402c-4012-8e4c-2bf60a7cd0fe202047-1-pd7i66.tiob.shp") %>% 
  st_transform(.,crs(mt_nlcd)) %>% 
  filter(!SITETYPE %in% c("FAS","HTC")) %>% # Remove fishing access sites and fish hatcheries
  st_buffer(.,200) %>% # Workaround to fix geometry that results from weird/convoluted boundaries
  group_by(SITEID) %>% # Group by site id
  summarise() %>% # Combine polygons with the same site id
  st_buffer(.,-200) %>% 
  dplyr::select() %>% 
  mutate("category" = "fishwildlifeparks",
    "object_id" = paste0(1:nrow(.),"_fwp"))

# Join PAD GAP 1 & 2 with fish and wildlife polygons
gap_fwp_join = st_join(pad_gap, fwp, left = T, largest = T)

# Get list of Conservation Easement polygons that joined with PAD data
joined_fwpIDs = na.omit(gap_fwp_join$object_id.y)

# Clean up joined data set -- anything that joined will take the ID of the Gap Status Polygon
gap_fwp_join = dplyr::select(gap_fwp_join,-c(category.y,object_id.y,)) # Remove columns from join associated with access data
colnames(gap_fwp_join)[1:2]= c("category","object_id")

# Filter out Conservation Easement parcels that joined with the GAP data set
fwp_fltr = filter(fwp,!(object_id %in% joined_fwpIDs))

# Combine the joined data set with the PAD Access parcels that did not join. 
gap_fwp_final = rbind(gap_fwp_join,fwp_fltr)

```


### 4. Adding in Conservation Easements
```{r conservation_easements}

# Conservation Easements
cons_easements = read_sf("../R_input_files/ConEasements/ConEasements.shp") %>% 
  st_transform(.,crs(mt_nlcd)) %>% 
  dplyr::select() %>% 
  mutate("category" = "conservation_easement",
    "object_id" = paste0(1:nrow(.),"_consease")) %>% 
  st_buffer(.,200) %>% # Workaround to fix geometry that results from weird/convoluted boundaries
  st_buffer(.,-200)
  
# Join Final PAD core areas with conservation easement core areas
gap_fwp_consease_join = st_join(gap_fwp_final,cons_easements, left = T, largest = T)

# Get list of Conservation Easement polygons that joined with PAD data
joined_conseaseIDs = na.omit(gap_fwp_consease_join$object_id.y)

# Clean up joined data set -- anything that joined will take the ID of the Gap Status Polygon
gap_fwp_consease_join = dplyr::select(gap_fwp_consease_join,-c(category.y,object_id.y,)) # Remove columns from join associated with access data

colnames(gap_fwp_consease_join)[1:2]= c("category","object_id")

# Filter out Conservation Easement parcels that joined with the GAP data set
consease_fltr = filter(cons_easements,!(object_id %in% joined_conseaseIDs))

# Combine the joined data set with the PAD Access parcels that did not join. 
gap_fwp_consease_final = rbind(gap_fwp_consease_join,consease_fltr)

# Empty geometry fixing
gap_fwp_consease_final$empty_geos = as.factor(is.na(st_dimension(gap_fwp_consease_final))) # find which one is empty
gap_fwp_consease_final = filter(gap_fwp_consease_final,empty_geos=="FALSE") %>%  # Filter out the empty one and remove the extra column
  select(-empty_geos)
    
```

### 5. Adding in Protected Area Database Restricted Access parcels
```{r pad_access}
## Create another set of polygons based on the "Access" column -- rationale is that many of these are manage or used a research for biodiversity, and many relatively natural places with closed or restricted access serve has habitat
pad_access = pad %>% 
  filter(d_Access %in% c("Restricted Access","Closed") & !d_Des_Tp %in% c("Agricultural Easement",
                                                                          "Private Agriculture",
                                                                          "Ranch Easement")) %>% 
  group_by(d_Access) %>% # Select access column
  summarise() %>% # Combine polygons based on the d_Access factor level
  st_buffer(.,200) %>% # Buffer to mitigate spatial issues that arise from complicated/convoluted polygon shapes
  as(.,"Spatial") %>% # Convert to shapefile
  disaggregate(.) %>% # Separate polygons that are not spatially connected
  st_as_sf() %>% # Turn back into spatial dataframe
  st_buffer(.,-200) %>% # remove the buffer
  dplyr::select() %>% # get rid of all non-geometry columns
  mutate("category" = "pad_access", # generate two new columns that contain the category and a unique ID
    "object_id" = paste0(1:nrow(.),"_access"))

# Spatial join between GAP and access data sets
all_join = st_join(gap_fwp_consease_final, pad_access, left = T, largest = T)

# Get a list of the Access object IDs that joined to the GAP data set
joined_accessIDs = na.omit(all_join$object_id.y)

# Clean up joined data set -- anything that joined will take the ID of the Gap Status Polygon
all_join = dplyr::select(all_join,-c(category.y,object_id.y,)) # Remove columns from join associated with access data

colnames(all_join)[1:2]= c("category","object_id")

# Filter out PAD Access parcels that joined with the GAP data set
pad_access_fltr = filter(pad_access,!object_id %in% joined_accessIDs)

# Combine the joined data set with the PAD Access parcels that did not join. 
all_final = rbind(all_join,pad_access_fltr)

all_final$area = as.numeric(st_area(all_final))

# Write shapefile to check
writeOGR(as(all_final,"Spatial"),
         dsn = "../R_output_files/circuitscape/core_area_shapefiles/MONTANA/",
         "MONTANA_coreareas",
         "ESRI Shapefile",
         overwrite_layer = T)

```

### 6. Function to crop to county
```{r create_county_core_area_function}

coreareas_fun = function(county_name, core_quality_table, shapefile = T, raster_nodes = T){
  
  print(county_name)
  
  county_i = filter(mt_counties, NAME == county_name) %>% 
    dplyr::select(NAME) %>% 
    as(.,"Spatial")
  
  county_i_cores = raster::intersect(core_areas,county_i) %>% # Crop core areas to county
    st_as_sf() # Turn into spatial data frame
  
  # Merge Core Areas SF with core quality table
  county_i_cores_merge = merge(county_i_cores,core_quality_table)
  
  county_i_cores_merge$core_quality = county_i_cores_merge$area*county_i_cores_merge$multiplier
  
  county_i_cores_final <<- county_i_cores_merge %>% 
    arrange(-core_quality) %>% 
    head(5)
  
  county_i_cores_final$core_id = 1:nrow(county_i_cores_final)
  
  if(shapefile){
  
  writeOGR(as(county_i_cores_final,"Spatial"),
           paste0("../R_output_files/circuitscape/core_area_shapefiles/",county_name),
           paste0(county_name,"_coreareas_final"),
           "ESRI Shapefile",
           overwrite_layer = T)
    
  }
  
  if(raster_nodes){
    
    core_centroids = st_centroid(x = county_i_cores_final)
    core_nodes <<- rasterize(x = core_centroids,y = mt_nlcd, field = "core_id")
    NAvalue(core_nodes) = -9999
    
    writeRaster(core_nodes,paste0("../R_output_files/circuitscape/core_node_asciis/",
                                  county_name,"_corenodes.asc"), format = "ascii", overwrite = T)
    
  }
  
}


```

### 7. Apply function
```{r apply_core_area_function}

# Need polygons for Linkage Mapper and Marxan (core polys)
# Rasterized centroids for Circuitscape (core nodes)
core_areas = readOGR("../R_output_files/circuitscape/core_area_shapefiles/MONTANA/MONTANA_coreareas.shp")

# Loop through all counties
county_names = as.list(mt_counties$NAME)

# Choose one county to create core areas for
# county_names = "CUSTER"

core_quality_table = data.frame(category = c("pad_gap","fishwildlifeparks","conservation_easement","pad_access"),
                                multiplier = c(4,3,2,1)) ## Do more digging about how these lands are managed to decide



for(i in 1:length(county_names)){
  
  county_name = county_names[i]
  
  coreareas_fun(county_name = county_name, core_quality_table = core_quality_table)
  
}

```
